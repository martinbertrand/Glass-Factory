Glass-Factory
=============

A simple sound wave generator in Java. Control frequencies with FM and AM modulation. Makes 80's sounds! 
Download the .jar file and it should run!

It is called Glass Factory because my initial intent was to create a sound generator that made crystal-like sounds.
Not the case here, but you can recreate virtually any sound one might have heard in an 1980's arcade, or in a 50's 
science-fiction movie. This code was mostly done to apply better OOP techniques along with my first foray into 
sound design. A future project could potentially see this software modified to manipulate sampled sounds instead 
of a simple base frequency.
